      # Introduction to Arrays
      
      An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each element can be accessed using an index.
      
      ## Key characteristics:
      
      - Fixed size (in many languages)
      - Elements are of the same type
      - O(1) time complexity for access
      - O(n) time complexity for search (without additional structures)
      
      ## Example:
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      // Creating an array
      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      
      // Accessing elements
      console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
      console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
      
      // Modifying elements
      numbers[1] = 10;
      console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5]

      # Basic Array Operations
      
      Let's explore the most common operations performed on arrays.
      
      ## Adding Elements
      
      - **Push**: Add to the end
      - **Unshift**: Add to the beginning
      
      ## Removing Elements
      
      - **Pop**: Remove from the end
      - **Shift**: Remove from the beginning
      - **Splice**: Remove from a specific position
      
      ## Example:
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
      
      // Adding elements
      fruits.push('orange');        // ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
      fruits.unshift('strawberry'); // ['strawberry', 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']
      
      // Removing elements
      fruits.pop();     // ['strawberry', 'apple', 'banana']
      fruits.shift();   // ['apple', 'banana']
      
      // Removing from specific position
      fruits.splice(1, 1); // ['apple']
      \`\`\`
      
      ## Time Complexity Analysis
      
      - Push/Pop: O(1) - Constant time
      - Shift/Unshift: O(n) - Linear time (requires reindexing)
      - Access by index: O(1) - Constant time

      # Array Traversal Techniques
      
      There are multiple ways to traverse an array in modern programming. Let's explore them.
      
      ## For Loop
      
      The classic approach.
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log(arr[i]);
      }
      \`\`\`
      
      ## For...of Loop
      
      A more modern and cleaner approach.
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      for (const element of arr) {
        console.log(element);
      }
      \`\`\`
      
      ## forEach Method
      
      Functional approach with a callback.
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      arr.forEach(element => {
        console.log(element);
      });
      \`\`\`
      
      ## Map, Filter, Reduce
      
      Advanced functional operations.
      
      \`\`\`javascript
      // Transform all elements
      const doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);
      
      // Filter elements
      const evens = arr.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
      
      // Reduce to a single value
      const sum = arr.reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0);
